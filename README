This Feature export simply provides content types, fields, and a View for a
simple photo gallery in Drupal 7. How you display the gallery is up to you,
but my preferred method is to attach the packaged Content Pane to a Panel.

This is simply a starting point and probably saves you about a hour or so
of work.
